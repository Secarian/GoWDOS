# Remarks
## Legacy Version of WDOS 
The previous release of the wdos is named &quot;WDOS Online System&quot; or &quot;WDOS Online Beta&quot; (AOB). For information and documentation for the beta version of this system, please read the &quot;WDOS Online Distributed Cloud System Documentation&quot; instead.

You can classify the difference between these two systems by identifying the programming language of the system.

| Version | Programming Language | File Extension |
| --- | --- | --- |
| WDOS Online Beta | PHP5 / PHP7 | .php |
| WDOS OS (WDOS Online 1.0) | Go | .go |

WDOS OS is written as &quot;wdos&quot; in the current documentation for simplicity and easy to read purposes.
